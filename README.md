# SmartSensorsResponseSystem
This project uses C++ and Arduino to create a system that triggers actions based on proximity and temperature. An ultrasonic sensor activates a servo motor when an object is nearby, while a temperature sensor triggers a DC motor, buzzer, and RGB LED when the temperature exceeds a set threshold.
